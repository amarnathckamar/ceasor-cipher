Caesar Cipher Overview:
In a Caesar cipher, each letter in the plaintext is shifted by a certain number (the key) to produce the ciphertext.
For example, with a shift (key) of 3, the letter 'A' becomes 'D', 'B' becomes 'E', and so on.
Key Features in Your Implementation:
Custom Alphabet List: Youâ€™re using a custom list (lis) that includes not only lowercase letters (a-z) 
                    but also numbers (0-9) and a few special characters (@, #, $, %, &, ?).

Shift Operation: You shift each character in the string by a user-defined key (k).
                This key determines how far the character moves in your custom alphabet list.

Wrapping Around: When the shifted index exceeds the length of the list, 
                the modulus operator (%) wraps it around to the beginning of the list (circular behavior).

Differences from a Standard Caesar Cipher:

Extended Character Set: A typical Caesar cipher only operates on alphabetic characters (A-Z or a-z). Your version extends this to include digits and special characters.
Case Handling: You convert input to lowercase before processing and return the encrypted output in uppercase. A traditional Caesar cipher generally preserves case (if designed to do so).

Summary:

Cipher Type: Substitution cipher (specifically a Caesar cipher variant).
Customization: You added numbers and symbols to the character set and provided the ability to repeat encryption and decryption multiple times.
This is a simple yet effective classical encryption technique, though it's relatively easy to break with modern cryptographic analysis.
